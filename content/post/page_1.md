In [Arthur Henderson Smith's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arthur_Henderson_Smith) book Chinese Characteristics, he wrote

*"...There is very little waste in the preparation of Chinese food, and everything is made to do so much duty as possible. What there is left, after an ordinary Chinese family have finished one of their meals would represent but a minute fraction of the net cost of the food. In illustration of this general fact, it is only necessary to glance at the physical condition of the Chinese dog or cat. It is the unhappy function of these animals to " live " on the leavings of human beings, and their lives are uniformly protracted at a poor dying rate..."*

Dude wrote this book in 1894, part of it is outdated and racist in modern standard and part of it is insightful and remains true till this day. For example, he got this right, the animal parts or offal that Westerns feed their pets are often considered as delicacies by the Chinese.

I love to cook and eat offal. Fish head, pig intestines, lamb kidney, blood, they are all delicious if being processed correctly. Like all things, there are pros and cons when dealing with offal.

Pros
- They are dirt cheap in the West because the target costumers are dogs.
- They have exotic and usually good tastes. I think everyone should try food that they are unfamiliar with.
- You are reducing food waste and saving the planet.

Cons
- They can take a lot of time and effort to process properly.
- Offal usually have high amount of purines, cholesterol and saturated fats. You should not eat too much of these. And always make sure your offal is fresh and clean.

Alright enough background, lets cook some quality meat.

**1. Ingredients**

Pig ears and all sorts of offal can usually be found in your local asian butcher. I bought three ears, they weigh about 500g and cost $4. Some other ingredients are
- The essentials: soy sauce, salt
- The optionals: ginger, scallions, garlic, star anise, bay leaf, cinnamon, sugar, sesame oil, vinegar, cooking wine

**2. Cleaning**

 There are tiny hairs on the ears. To get rid of them you can either brush the ear with the edge of your knife or burn the surface of the ear with flame. Afterwards, clean the ears thoroughly.

**3. Blanching**

 Blanching or 飞水 (fly in the water) is a common technique when dealing with meat. The purpose is to get rid off the blood, and other unwanted stuff and smells from the meat by boiling it in water.

 When blanching meat, always start with a pot of cold water. Put the ears in the pot, add pieces of ginger and a splash of cooking wine (any alcohol will do). Bring the water to boil and continue to cook for about 5 minutes.

 The water should now floated with blood and fat. Get the ears out and clean them. The cooking water should be discarded.

 **4. Braising**

 Braising or 卤 is a slow cooking technique that gives tough meat tender and better favor. The meat will be submerged in the cooking liquid and cook for a long time. Since pig ears are relatively soft, ~40 minutes should be sufficient.   

![Braising](/images/ear2.jpg "Prepare to braise")

 Add pig ears to the pot along with salt, sugar, ginger, scallions, garlic, star anise, bay leaf, cinnamon and most importantly soy sauce. Make sure there are plenty of salt and soy sauce because the cooking liquid should be salty to give the meat favor. Add enough water so the ears are fully submerged.

 Bring the pot to boil and then simmering for 40 minutes.

 **5. Dishing up**

 Bring the ears to a plate and let it cool to room temperature. The left over cooking liquid can be saved for future use (it will become jelly after cooling down due to the collagen from pig ears).

 In the mean while, prepare some vegetables to mix with the ears. Thin slices of cucumbers and carrots are perfect match for the crunchy texture of pig ears. I have neither of those, so I added coriander to make the dish less meaty. 

 Cut the ears to thin slices and mix it with the veges and some sesame oil and vinegar, add additional salt and sugar if still lacks favor.

This method can be used for a lot of other meats, for example silverside, a tough cut of beef is perfect to be braised. The only variable will be the cooking time.

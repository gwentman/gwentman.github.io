Fårikål, literally means sheep in cabbage, is the national dish of Norway. It is a lamb cabbage stew with salt and black peppercorns as the only condiment.

I learnt this from my Norwegian colleague. While she didn't speak highly of this dish (partially because she is a proud vegetarian), I decided to try this in my kitchen. There are two reasons.  

- I knew nothing about Norwegian or Scandinavian cuisine other than the Ikea meatballs. I'd like to know more.
- The receipt of this dish seems to be uncannily simple, yet it becomes the national dish through not one but two competitions. What is the magic?

So after some extensive research on Youtube, I am ready to go, let's first talk about the ingredients

**1. Ingredients**

- Lamb or mutton pieces, preferably with plenty of bones and fat, the cheaper the cuts the better, I used lamb shoulder, which to my surprise is not cheap at all
- Cabbage, your average ugly green cabbages
- Black peppercorns, this seems to be the only non-negotiable thing, has to be whole peppercorns
- Salt
- Flour, to thicken the sauce
- Water
- That's all you need, I am serious.

**2. Preparation**

 The preparation of this dish is minimal, you only need to cut the cabbage to large chucks along the stern, so they don't break down during the slow cooking process.

 You will then need a large pot with lid, place the fatty meat pieces on the bottom, cover with a layer of cabbage, then spread a handful of salt, peppercorns and flour. You then repeat this layering process. I made 2 layers for about 1.2 kg of meat and two third of a cabbage.

Finally you add water, the amount of water should not be excessive, maybe reach two third of your layers. From my understanding, this is more like a steam dish than a stew. Pretty easy so far.

**3. Cooking**

Bring your water to boil, then lower the heat to simmer for 2-3 hours. Add water during the cooking process if necessary. You can also boil some potatoes to have a more complete Norwegian experience.

**3. Taste Test**

The final product is not the most appealing thing. As expected, after slow cooking, the cabbage and lamb (didn't even brown it) becomes an almost desaturated slop. And I also have to mention, after about 20 minutes of cooking, you kitchen will be filled with the smell of cabbage, which my Norwegian friend has correctly pointed out before as unpleasant.

Nevertheless, I was excited to try this dish, so excited that I even bought a can of Norwegian beer to go with it.

Fårikål is not bad, in fact not bad at all. The lamb is tender, the cabbage is soft but not mushy, the sauce is rich and flavorful from the bones and rendered fat, and with salt and pepper as the only spices, the dish really concentrates on the gameyness of lamb and the slight sourness of cabbage. The only problem is that I cooked too much for one person.

Actually, this is not even a problem, as the Norwegians commonly regard that “second-day fårikål” as the best. To confirm this statement, I microwaved my fårikål with some left-over rice. The end-result is amazing. The cabbage, after absorbing the sauce overnight, has become the star of this dish. I now understand why fårikål is so beloved in Norway, what is better than sharing a hearty meal with family and friends in a cold Nordic night?

**4. TLDR**

Fårikål is delicious and easy to make, and you should give it a go.
